Cache Simulator Assignment
--------------------------

In this assignment you will design a basic cache simulator.

Cache specifications are passed from command line. The specifications include
cache size, associativity and block size. Both cache size and block size are
specified in bytes. Along with cache specifications, an input files is passed
that has read and write commands with associated address and data values in hex
format. 

I have provided a top level file 'cacheSim.cc' that reads command line
parameters, parses the inputs and calls appropriate methods of your base cache to
perform required operations. I have also provided BaseCache class skeleton,
that you will fill to complete. Feel free to add any additional class variables
or methods as per your design requirements. For your ease, I have labelled all
the methods, variables that you need to write with 'WRITE ME'.

Use Makefile provided to compile the assignment. 

Command to run the cache simulator (for 128KB cache, associativity 8 and
block size of 128bytes) is :
	./cacheSim 131072 8 128 input1.txt
Sample input and output files are provided.

Assumptions:
1. Writes and reads are always 32bits long.
2. Block Size is always multiple of 4 bytes.
3. Writes are successful only when a write hit occurs or an empty block is
available in the desired set. This removes implementation of any cache line
replacement policies. 
4. Read and Write addresses are 32bit aligned. This removes the necessity to
check for any partial data availability.
